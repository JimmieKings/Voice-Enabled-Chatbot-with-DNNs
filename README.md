# Voice-Enabled-Chatbot-with-DNNs
This project integrates deep learning and speech recognition to create an interactive, voice-enabled chatbot. 
Using NLP techniques and speech recognition, the chatbot transcribes user voice input to text, generates responses, and supports both voice and text interaction modes. 
This repository demonstrates how to leverage neural networks and speech-to-text in an easy-to-use Streamlit interface.
